## About

Chat with Laravel is a demo site. It is an example of how you can build a basic AI chatbot for interacting with your own content. In the case of this website, we're using Laracon video transcripts as the content that you can interact with.

Right now, a lot in this project is hard-coded. It's not meant to be production-ready but more of a starting point for you to build your own chatbot.

## Source code

All code for this website is open source, on [GitHub](https://github.com/farez/chatwithlaravel).
